I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by first writing clear code that is easy to understand. Next, I test my code thoroughly using a combination of automated tests and manual testing to identify any issues. Finally performing security testing and following security best practices to ensure the code is secure through methods such as implementing access controls. You can interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program using various methods. The first method is to conduct user research to understand the user needs and requirements, and then creating user personas to represent different user groups and their needs. Involving users in the development process is another way to interpret user needs by collaborating with them through the design and development process to gather feedback and make improvements. I approach software designing by first identifying the problem the software will address and conducting research to understand user needs. When designing software, the needs and preferences of the end-users are a key factor in the design process. Then security and performance are the next important aspects I consider when designing software. Using these factors as the guide for my design allows me create software that is both functional and meets the needs of users.
